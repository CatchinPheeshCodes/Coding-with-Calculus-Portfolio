# Coding With Calculus: Portfolio
This is a record of my best contributions for this course.  I have included all of the relevant programming assignments that were used to learn some of the fundamentals of calculus.  Applying these concepts practically was an excellent way to approach this topic. 
## Key Mathematical Concepts:
- Rate of Change Modeling: SIR, Prey/Predator Models, Fermentation Models
- Accumulation Functions
- The Derivative
- Differential Equations
- Finding Roots: Newton's Method
- Riemann Sums
- The Fundamendal Theorem of Calculus
## Key Programming Tools:
- Python
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Fundamentals (Variables, Loops, Data Structures, etc.)
## Key Contributions:
- In an effort to collaborate effectively during the first few weeks of this course, I organized a polling system in our program's discord server to help organize the efforts of some students that chose to partcipiate.  This was a great way to foster effective teamwork early on, with broader conversations and collaboration shifting to Piazza for the duration of the course.
- See highlighted Piazza posts in pdf .
## Final Project:
- In progress.  For the final project of this course, I have chosen to implement a ray tracer.  I will use 'Ray Tracing in a Weekend' as a guide.  This will be implemented in C++, and is more focused on linear algebra concepts.
